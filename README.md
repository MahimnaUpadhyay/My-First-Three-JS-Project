# My-First-Three-JS-Project
Hey there! Hope everyone is doing great :) . So Recently I was scrolling through websites for inspiration and I found one Website which was made entirely in 3D. I was so stunned with it and thought, "Hey let's try 
to develop some 3D website." And here I'm presenting everyone my 1st ever Three JS project. 

I read Three JS docs and develop a small project where, I am showing our little tiny planet Earth spinning on it's axis.

# Technology Used:-
1. HTML 
2. SCSS
3. Three JS
4. Vite
